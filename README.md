# dlo - CLI Client for dict.leo.org

dlo is a CLI client for the german - english dictionay at http://dict.leo.org

## Ideas 

* Implement some checks (ARGV[0], language identifier in xml)
* Bold/Highlight searched word
* Allow placeholder (*)
* Support Search Options (provided by leo: Grundwortschatz, Fachwortschatz)
* Support multiword search
* Select type for query (adjadv, verb, subst, example, phrase)
* Reverse order of results to display most important ones at the bottom near the promt.
